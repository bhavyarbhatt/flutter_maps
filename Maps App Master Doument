The Drawer Menu provides access to additional options like Order History and Settings.

The Sign Up and Login Screens are used for user authentication, while the Onboarding Screen introduces the app's features to new users. The Order Tracking Screen is accessed after placing an order, allowing users to monitor their delivery status.

The Admin Dashboard is a separate interface for business owners, providing comprehensive management capabilities for orders, products/services, users, and analytics.

Colot Theme

Based on the design principles and examples from the top on-demand delivery apps, here are some recommendations for the color scheme and theme to create an attractive and professional-looking app for your portfolio:

## Color Scheme

- Use a combination of bright, appealing colors that align with your brand identity and create a positive emotional response. Some popular color combinations include:
  - Azure blue and light red[2]
  - White backgrounds with black text for contrast and legibility[2]

- Avoid using the typical red-yellow combo that many food delivery apps use. Choose a unique color palette that helps your app stand out[2].

- Colors like blue instill trust and reliability, while reds can stimulate hunger. Balance them to create an effective color scheme[2].

## Typography

- Use an easy-to-read, legible font that complements your app's visual style. A custom version of the Rubik typeface, which is a slightly rounded sans-serif font, works well for food delivery apps[2].

- Ensure the typography is large enough to be easily readable on small screens.

- Maintain consistent typography throughout the app for a professional look.

## Theme and Design

- Opt for a clean, minimalist design with plenty of white space. Avoid clutter to make the app easy to navigate[2].

- Use high-quality, appetizing images of food to make the app visually appealing and stimulate users' appetites[1][2].

- Incorporate subtle animations and visual cues to guide users through the interface and provide feedback on their actions. However, use these sparingly to avoid slowing down the app's performance[1].

- Maintain consistent branding throughout the app, including the logo, colors, and imagery. This creates familiarity and trust with users[1].

- Design the app with thumb-friendly touch targets that are easy to tap, especially for key actions like placing orders[1].

By following these design principles and drawing inspiration from the top on-demand delivery apps, you can create a visually appealing and user-friendly app that showcases your skills as a Flutter developer. The combination of a thoughtful color scheme, legible typography, and clean, consistent design will help your app stand out in your portfolio.
